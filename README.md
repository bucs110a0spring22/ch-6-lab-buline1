## SUMMARY:
This code takes the 3n+1 function provided and finds the number of iterations until the function output is 1 starting with the input for the upper bound given by the user. The second part of the code plots the start value to the iterations performed at that value from 1 to the upper bound value.

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS:
I believe all parts of the lab were completed. Had trouble with replit buffering so I was unable to fully check my code when submitting.

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS:
I am concerned the code will not run when getting graded. The code runs but the plot does not appear on the screen. If this is the case I would appreciate the option to re-submit.
